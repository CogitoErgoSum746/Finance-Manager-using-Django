The railway reservation system facilitates the passengers to enquire about the
trains available one the basis of source and destination. 

The aim 
of this project is to design and develop a database maintaining the records of
different trains, train status and passengers.

This is organinzed using entities like User, Passenger, Train, Route.etc.

For each User, we store a unique ID and passcode.

For passenger, Gender, Age and seat no.

In case of Train, a unique train_id and the train's status as to the seat is
booked or still in wait.

Route keeps track of attributes like no. of stops, depart_time,
final_station.etc.
